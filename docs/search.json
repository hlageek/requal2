You can download and install R from here. You will also need a web browser with JavaScript support (i.e. any of the standard issue browsers like Firefox, Chrome, or Safari).\nSimply install the latest release of the requal package from R-Universe repository by copying and pasting the following single-line command into the R console:\ninstall.packages(\"requal\", repos = c(\"https://re-qda.r-universe.dev\", \"https://cloud.r-project.org\"))\nAlternatively, you can install a Requal release from GitHub by following these steps (assuming you have R installed on your machine):\n\nDownload the current release of Requal from Releases. The installation file is in the requal_&lt;VERSION_NUMBER&gt;.tar.gz format.\nOpen the R console and install the remotes package by running install.packages(\"remotes\") command.\nInstall the requal package by running remotes::install_local(file.choose()) command and selecting the downloaded release file on your hard drive.\n\n\nUsage (desktop)\nAfter installation, Requal can be launched from the R console with the following command:\nrequal::run_app()\n\n\n\nRequal start screen\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment version\nThe development version contains the latest features, but might be less stable than a released version.\nTo access the latest features, you can install the development version of Requal from the developer’s R-Universe repository by running this code in R:\ninstall.packages(\"requal\", repos = c(\"https://hlageek.r-universe.dev\", \"https://cloud.r-project.org\"))\nUsage is the same as in the server and desktop versions.\n\n\nServer version\nThe server version is intended for online teamwork or teaching. To use the server version, you need to install Requal on a server or ask your organization’s IT staff to install it for you. Requal Wiki contains a basic guide for a server setup."

However, for the ease of use, we are also experimenting with a standalone version of Requal. A first version of standalone Requal for macOS is now available.\nInstructions:\nSimply download and mount the disk image file and move the Requal.app file to your Applications folder.\nAs the Requal macOS app is not certified by Apple, you will be asked for a permission to open it when running for the first time. Go to System Preferences -&gt; Security & Privacy and select Open Anyway for Requal.app.\nThis is still in experimental stage and we are providing the macOS app for beta-testing. We are curious to hear about your experience (both negative and positive) with running standalone Requal, e.g. in Requal Discussions.\nOf course, if the standalone app is not working, you can always use Requal through the standard R installation."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Requalverse is a conceptual framework for the development of Requal as an open source research software in accordance with FOSS principles. The framework gives users the freedom and tools to modify Requal to suit their analytical needs and preferences. Requal itself depends on the well-established culture of openness, collaboration, and sharing in the R community. With this background, Requalverse transcends the paradigms of closed-source, proprietary CAQDAS and implements the infrastructure of open-source software for computer-assisted qualitative data analysis.\nThrough building Requalverse, we not only aim to provide more capabilities and features to the users, but also to bridge the qualitative and quantitative research communities, support mixed-method research, and open new pathways for qualitative data analysis.\nRequalverse takes the technical form of a collection of open source R packages that extend the functionality of Requal by following a simple set of development guidelines. Each package in the Requalverse is a miniature Shiny application that can be launched from the Requal app. It can be simple and oriented towards a specific task or as complex as its developers see fit. The architecture of the extension modules even allows them to be used as self-contained applications, although most of them will be probably tailored to work within the context of Requal.\nOn the Requal side, we provide an API interface that simplifies and supervises database operations and data transfer between the Requal app and Requalverse packages. Requal continues to handle user permissions and data integrity. At the same time, users retain full control over which extensions are installed and used in their projects.\nRequalverse makes both the main app and the extensions more maintainable and sustainable by reducing their respective dependencies. Requal can narrow its focus on being a simple and intuitive interface for qualitative data, while the extension modules can unleash the full power of the R ecosystem to important but non-essential advanced capabilities."
